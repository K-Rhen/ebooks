# ebooks
LaTeX source files for VividCortex's ebooks.

This isn't intended to be a distribution mechanism for the ebooks---the final versions will be hosted on VividCortex's website. But it's a good place to collaborate on making them, getting external reviews, etc.

The directory organization convention is that each ebook will have a `.tex` file in the top level,
and a directory containing figures, reference material, etc.

You'll need the Roboto font and xelatex to build the PDFs, due to the custom fonts.

A quickstart for Mac users for installing LaTeX:

* Install BasicTex
* Install Tex Live Utility from GitHub
* Install packages using it, as needed
* The titletoc package is part of titlesec
